# easyFold

**easyFold** is an interactive, structure-aware platform for **AlphaFold3 job management, visualization, and domain-level interpretation**.  
It integrates confidence metrics (pLDDT, PAE), contact maps, and automated domain segmentation to enable **deep, interpretable analysis of predicted protein structures**.

### 🔹 AlphaFold3 Job Management
- Docker-based AlphaFold3 execution
- User-level job submission, tracking, and result management
- Administrator dashboard for global job monitoring and control
- Unique job IDs to avoid conflicts across users

### 🔹 Interactive Structure Visualization
- **3D structure visualization** using Mol\*
- Supports PDB / mmCIF outputs
- Optional domain-colored structures (via B-factor encoding)

### 🔹 Confidence & Contact Analysis
- **pLDDT per-residue curve**
- **PAE heatmap** visualization
- **Contact map** (CA–CA, configurable cutoff)
- Mouse-based region selection on PAE and contact maps

### 🔹 Domain-Aware Interpretation (Optional)
- Integrated **Merizo** for automatic domain segmentation
- Domain boundary visualization:
  - Sequence domain bar
  - Domain overlays on PAE and contact maps
  - Structure highlighting by domain
- Quantitative **intra- / inter-domain contact density** analysis

### 🔹 Linked, Interpretable Views
- Domain bar ↔ PAE ↔ contact map ↔ 3D structure are fully linked
- Selecting a region or domain highlights corresponding residues across views
- Designed for **structure-informed domain interpretation**, not just visualization

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

easyFold is **not** just a wrapper for AlphaFold.

It is designed to support:
- Domain-level reasoning
- Structure-aware interpretation
- Confidence-guided analysis
- Exploration of inter-domain coupling and organization

This makes easyFold suitable for:
- Multi-domain proteins
- Large bacterial proteins
- Toxin systems
- Structure-based functional annotation studies

## 📊 Result Dashboard
Each job provides a multi-tab dashboard:

Overview: job metadata and artifacts

Structure: interactive 3D visualization

Confidence: pLDDT, PAE, contact map

Domains: Merizo-based domain segmentation and statistics

Compare: multi-model / seed comparison

Logs: real-time execution logs

## 🧪 Domain & Contact Metrics
easyFold automatically computes:

Intra-domain contact density

Inter-domain contact density

Observed vs. possible contact ratios

These metrics support:

Domain validity assessment

Structural coupling analysis

Domain-level functional hypotheses
